This is reffs. Here's what you should know.

1. It's set up using jekyll and bootstrap in the ashes of tivoli.
2. To stage it locally, you need to run `bundle exec jekyll serve` in a new Terminal tab, then open up 127.0.0.1:4000
3. The site is set up using Github pages, so every time you commit, the changes will be public at tallneil.github.io.
4. I'm going to set up a custom domain so the site lives at reffs.co.
