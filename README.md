### About
In 2019, I had an idea for a platform for distributing referral codes that people can use when they sign up for services like Robinhood, Uber Eats, Doordash, etc.

+ Unlike products like Honey and Rakuten, Reffs would be focused on referral codes, not promo codes.
+ Every code on Reffs would be manually verified by an admin (me).

To validate the idea, I used my own referral codes, hosted the site at reffs.co, and took out paid search ads. 

### Learnings
+ Several people converted (used my referral code) but didn't activate (i.e. place an order with Doordash). To solve for this, I could add a module to the site encouraging activations. 
+ Overall, CAC > CLTV (the customer acquisition cost was greater than the customer lifetime value), making me think paid search may not be the best path forward with a side project like this.
+ Several people Googled "Reffs," probably because they wanted to know if it's a legit service. I haven't put up a landing/about page, but I should.

### Path forward
I'll probably retire Reffs. I don't know. For now, it's not active.

### Stack
The site is built with Jekyll and Bootstrap. To run it locally, run `bundle exec jekyll serve`.
